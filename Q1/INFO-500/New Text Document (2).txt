Region based segmentation

There are 2 basic forms of this method, region growing and split then merge.
Region growing  is that we start from a seed pixel in the object that we are interested in and let it grow towards the edge,
then we recruit the neighbour pixels.
Split and merge is that we split the image iteratively until every subpart is homogeneous, then we merge adjacent
homogeneous subparts. This homogeneity criterion can be evaluated by the variance, entropy or co-occurence matrix

The idea is to consider an image as an 2D and a half data, in which we consider the gray level as the altitude.
Then we look at the gradient of the image, the borders of the objects correspond to the crests of the gradient surface.
So in an image, there are multiple basins and in each basin we have a local minima, and the borders can be detected
each time then two adjacent basins are merging, we can add a virtual dam and it's the border.
advantage: sensitive to the borders.
limitations: over-segmentation since there could be two many regions for each local minima.
solution: either use the pre-fiter image by using for example the median fiter or use marked watershed.
or merge adjacent basins which have similar gray level by labeling the remaining regions after removing unwanted edges.
Instead of starting from the minimum value, you can use a relatively high grayscale pixel as a starting point
